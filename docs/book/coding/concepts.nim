# Core Concepts

## Units

Entities/objects in Enu are referred to as units, and have a base type of `Unit`. Currently there are `Build` units
(voxel objects) and `Bot` units (the robot). There will be more in the future.

`me` is the unit that owns a script, and is equivalent to `self`/`this` in other environments. `me` was selected
because it's easier for a child to type. `me.` can be auto-inserted when accessing properties of the unit. For example,
`me.speed = 10` would commonly be written as `speed = 10`. There are probably bugs with this behavior.  Please report
them.

## Prototypes

Enu uses a prototype based object system for units. To allow a unit to be a prototype, you give it a name:

```nim
name ghost
```

Then create a new instance in a different script with `.new`:

```nim
var ghost2 = ghost.new
```

You can also provide parameters, which can be overridden when creating a new instance:

```nim
name ghost(color = white, speed = 5, spookiness = 10)
```

These become properties of the unit (ie `me.spookiness = 5`), but can be treated like variables in the unit's script
due to auto `me` insertion (`spookiness = 200`).

To create a new instance with specific property values:

```nim
var ghost2 = ghost.new(spookiness = 11)
```

Parameters can have a default value (`spookiness = 10`), which makes them optional when creating a new instance. If they
should be required, or there's no reasonable default value to use, specify a type (`spookiness: int`) instead, or omit
both the value and the type, which will make the type `auto`. Because `auto` can be implicit, `name ghost(a, b: int)`
treats parameters differently than `proc ghost(a, b: int)` would. With the proc, `a` and `b` are both `int`, whereas
the `name` version would make `a` `auto` and `b` `int`.

`speed`, `color`, `global` can always be passed to a new instance, even if the prototype name doesn't include them.
