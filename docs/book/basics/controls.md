  change your view without having to switch away from what you're doing.
- `Cmd+P / Ctrl+P` - Pause scripts.
- `Cmd+Shift+S / Ctrl+Shift+S` - Save and reload all scripts, then pause. If you have a script that makes a unit

  can be edited.

Enu currently includes 6 block types/colors, and 1 object model (a robot). This will be greatly
expanded in the future.

## Building

Drop a block or robot with the left mouse button/controller trigger, remove it with the right. Adjoining blocks will be
combined into a single structure. With the mouse captured, building works more or less like MineCraft. Release the mouse
by pressing ESC to draw blocks using the mouse cursor.

Code by switching to the code tool by left clicking/triggering on an object or structure. Changes are applied when the
code window is closed (ESC key) or CTRL is pressed. Holding CTRL will also temprarly grab the mouse and allow you to
change your position.
