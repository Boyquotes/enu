Welcome! This is Tutorial 1, which covers the basics of playing and coding in
Enu. If you're new, you should try it. It won't take long.

If you're not new, here are some other things to do:

- [Reset Tutorial](<nim://reset_level()>). This resets and restarts this
  tutorial. Any changes you've made to the world will be lost.

- [Help](https://Ä“.nu/docs/intro.html). Help!

- [Load Inky: Isolation](<nim://load_level("tutorial-2")>). `Inky: Isolation` is
  a simple game made with Enu. You can see how it was built in
  [this video](https://youtu.be/9e9sLsmsu_o).

- [Load CodeBots](<nim://load_level("codebots-1", "codebots")>). `CodeBots` is
  an in-progress coding game that
  [FrogTower](https://www.youtube.com/@frogtower) is working on.

- [Load default world](<nim://load_level("default-1", "default")>).
